## What Could have been Improved?

This project utilized localstorage because of the small scale of the application,
to improve I would have used Redux instead which is widely used for large scale applications,
if this application were any bigger redux would have been essential.

Styling could be improved to look more organized.

I could have broken up the app into containers and components.
