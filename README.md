Take home interview test for Konrad Group

## How to Run

`npm run build`
`npm start`

## What Could have been Improved?

This project utilized localstorage because of the small scale of the application,
to improve I would have used Redux instead.

Styling is very basic. I used material-ui to do the basic styling but it could definitely
look better.
