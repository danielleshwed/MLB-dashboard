## What Could have been Improved?

This project utilized localstorage because of the small scale of the application,
to improve I would have used Redux instead which is widely used for large scale applications,
if this application were any bigger redux would have been essential.

Styling could be improved. More detail on the details page like home and away team name and more clear which players are on
which team in the batting table. (batters for each team append to the same table in this version)

I could have broken up the app into containers and components.
